    "### **PHYS 5120: Homework 2 - Molecular Dynamics of Lennard-Jones Argon**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Jesse (Zhaoxiang) Chen\n",
    "**Date:** September 24, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This report details the process and results of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of liquid Argon, as outlined in the PHYS 5120 Homework 2 assignment. The primary goal is to modify a provided Python script (`md.py`) to simulate Argon under specific physical conditions ($T=173$ K, $\\rho=1432 \\text{ kg/m}^3$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow involved several key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Parameterization**: Converting the experimental units for Argon into the reduced Lennard-Jones (LJ) units used by the simulation code.\n",
    "2.  **Simulation**: Running the modified code to generate a stable trajectory of the system, separated into an equilibration phase and a production phase.\n",
    "3.  **Output & Visualization**: Saving the production trajectory in the Gromacs `.gro` format and visualizing it with VMD[cite: 15].\n",
    "4.  **Analysis**: Writing custom Python functions to analyze the saved trajectory and calculate key physical properties from first principles, including the Radial Distribution Function (g(r)) and the Diffusion Coefficient (D) via two different methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Simulation Setup and Unit Conversion**\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately model Argon, the physical target parameters must be converted into the dimensionless LJ units that the `md.py` script uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given Experimental Data for Argon[cite: 7]:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * $\\epsilon/k\\_{B} = 119.8 \\text{ K}$\n",
    "  * $\\sigma = 3.405 \\text{ Å}$\n",
    "  * $M = 0.03994 \\text{ kg/mol}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Temperature, $T = 173 \\text{ K}$\n",
    "  * Density, $\\rho = 1432 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculations for Reduced Units:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Reduced Temperature ($T^*$):**\n",
    "    $T^* = T / (\\epsilon/k\\_B) = 173 \\text{ K} / 119.8 \\text{ K} \\approx 1.444$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Reduced Number Density ($\\rho^*$):**\n",
    "    First, the mass of a single Argon atom ($m$) is calculated from the molar mass ($M$) and Avogadro's number ($N\\_A$):\n",
    "    $m = M / N\\_A = 0.03994 \\text{ kg/mol} / (6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}) \\approx 6.633 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg}$.\n",
    "    The number density ($n$) is then $n = \\rho / m = 1432 / 6.633 \\times 10^{-26} \\approx 2.159 \\times 10^{28} \\text{ atoms/m}^3$.\n",
    "    Finally, the reduced density is $\\rho^* = n \\sigma^3 = (2.159 \\times 10^{28} \\text{ m}^{-3}) \\times (3.405 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^3 \\approx 0.851$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Time Unit Conversion:**\n",
    "    The characteristic time unit in LJ systems is $\\tau = \\sigma \\sqrt{m/\\epsilon} \\approx 2.15 \\text{ ps}$. The assignment requires a production run of at least 12 ps, which corresponds to $12 / 2.15 \\approx 5.58$ reduced time units. Using a time step of $dt=0.004$, this requires at least $5.58 / 0.004 \\approx 1400$ steps. To be safe, I will use **1000 steps for equilibration** and **1500 steps for production**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These calculated values will be used to parameterize the simulation script."
